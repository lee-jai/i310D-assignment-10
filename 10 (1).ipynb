    "Based on the reults of the test, I found that the model tends to give higher toxicity scores for comments that contain provanity than comments that are threatening. One explanation for this is that the Perspective API model values profanity scores more than threat scores. The datasets that Perspective API was trained with is likely to be biased in that there probably were more comments with profanity than threats. In one aspect, it makes sense that profanity is more focused in the model, as profanity is more commonly seen online than threats. However, to humans, threats are considered more toxic that provanity. Perspective API may want to take threatening comment more seriously. Below is a second test to check my explanation of these results."
